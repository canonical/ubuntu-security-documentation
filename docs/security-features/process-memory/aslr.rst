Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
#########################################

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a security feature that randomizes
the location of key memory areas. This is implemented jointly; the kernel
randomizes the initial process layout (i.e., the stack and heap), while the
user-space Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) loader randomizes the locations
of the executable and its shared libraries. This makes it more difficult for
attackers to reliably predict or locate memory addresses when attempting to read
or corrupt memory.

It is one of the most widely deployed memory safety mitigations in modern
operating systems. On most modern Linux distributions, ASLR is enabled
by default.

Configuration
=============

ASLR is controlled system-wide by the value of ``/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space``.

.. list-table:: ``/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`` values
   :widths: 15 85
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value
     - Meaning
   * - 0
     - ASLR is off.
   * - 1
     - Partial ASLR. The addresses of stack, mmap base and vDSO page are randomized.
       This is the default if the ``CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK`` option is enabled.
   * - 2 (default for most systems)
     - Full ASLR. Additionally enable heap randomization.
       This is the default if ``CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK`` is disabled.

To temporarily change the value, it can be done via the ``proc`` file system::

   echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

Or via ``sysctl``::

   sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=1

To make it persistent across reboots, add a line to a config file in ``/etc/sysctl.d/``. For example,::

   echo "kernel.randomize_va_space=1" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/aslr.conf

.. _types-of-aslr:

Types of ASLR
=============

See `test-kernel-security.py <https://git.launchpad.net/qa-regression-testing/tree/scripts/test-kernel-security.py>`__ for regression tests for all the different types of ASLR.

.. _stack-aslr:

Stack ASLR
~~~~~~~~~~

Each time a program is executed, its stack is placed at a different starting
address in memory.

This makes it harder to locate where to attack or deliver an executable payload
in memory.

.. _mmap-aslr:

Libs/mmap ASLR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each execution of a program results in different base addresses for dynamically 
loaded libraries and memory-mapped regions. This means that shared libraries, 
memory-mapped files, and other ``mmap``-allocated regions are placed at 
randomized addresses on each execution.

This randomization makes it significantly harder for attackers to reliably locate 
memory addresses, which is essential for attacks like "return-to-libc" attacks
that require known addresses of library functions or mapped content.

.. _exec-aslr:

Exec ASLR
~~~~~~~~~

Each execution of a program that has been built with "-fPIE -pie"
(see :ref:`Built as PIE <compiler-flags-pie>`) will get loaded into a different memory location.


This makes it harder to locate in memory where to attack or jump to when
performing memory-corruption-based attacks.

.. _brk-aslr:

``brk`` ASLR
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each execution of a program results in a different base address for the heap.

Small ``malloc`` allocations are served from the heap by adjusting the program
break with the ``brk`` system call. Randomizing the starting addresses of the
executable and the heap makes it harder for an attacker to locate code or
data for an exploit.

.. _vdso-aslr:

vDSO ASLR
~~~~~~~~~

Each execution of a program results in a random vDSO location.

The vDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) offers a selected set of kernel space
routines (e.g. ``gettimeofday``) to user-space applications to improve the
performance of system calls by avoiding expensive context switches. Randomizing
the address of the syscall entry point avoids "jump-into-syscall" attacks which
require the attacker to reliably guess the address needed to hijack the
control flow.
