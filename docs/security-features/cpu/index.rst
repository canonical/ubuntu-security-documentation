CPU features
============
Four CPU features on x86-based hardware are not always available by default out of the 
box. Many BIOS manufacturers disable the features in a conservative attempt to help 
legacy operating systems that may perform strangely when these features are available.

Ubuntu can fully utilize these features, and as such, these pages will attempt to describe
where to find these features in BIOS, and how to turn them on.
