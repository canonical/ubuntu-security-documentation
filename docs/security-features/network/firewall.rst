`ufw <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW>`_ is a frontend for iptables and is installed by default in Ubuntu (users must explicitly enable it). 

Ufw is well-suited for host-based firewalls, providing a framework for managing a netfilter firewall, as well as a command-line interface for firewall manipulation. It simplifies complex iptables commands while still offering advanced controls for experienced users. 

Regression tests: `ufw tests <https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jdstrand/ufw/trunk/files>`_.
