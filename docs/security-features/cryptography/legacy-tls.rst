Older versions of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, including SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1, contain inherent vulnerabilities and do not provide the necessary security. 

For this reason, Ubuntu 20.04 and later proactively disable these protocols, requiring more secure alternatives.

To communicate with legacy systems, it is possible to re-enable these protocols. More information is available in `this discourse article <https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/default-to-tls-v1-2-in-all-tls-libraries-in-20-04-lts/12464/8>`_.
