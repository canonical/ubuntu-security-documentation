Livepatch security notices
##########################

The Livepatch Security Notices (LSN) are notifications issued for kernel
vulnerabilities. They can be accessed by following our `Security
notices <https://ubuntu.com/security/notices>`__ or by subscribing to
the `Ubuntu Security
Announcements <https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce>`__
mailing list. LSNs are released for every high or critical kernel
vulnerability. They are released for: \* Announcing a new livepatch
addressing a vulnerability. \* Communicating an alert if a livepatch
cannot be released describing the reason and possible mitigation. In
that case \* a standard `Ubuntu security
notice <https://ubuntu.com/security/notices>`__ (USN) will be released
with packages along side it to fix the issue. \* the livepatch client
will issue a warning that an update and reboot is necessary.
