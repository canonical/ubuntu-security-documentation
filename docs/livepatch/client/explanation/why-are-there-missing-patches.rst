Why are there missing patches
##############################

Livepatches are only produced for `supported
kernels <https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch/docs/kernels>`__, and
only for CVEs that require a Linux kernel modification to fix the
problem (for example, a CPU bug may not have a kernel fix). Further,
livepatches do not address security problems in Ubuntu software
packages, or in third-party drivers that do not ship as part of the
Linux kernel (i.e.Â NVIDIA GPU drivers).

Livepatch is intended to provide protection from security issues in
*addition* to regular kernel security updates, so be sure to read and
follow the security advisories published in Ubuntu Security
Notifications (`USNs <https://ubuntu.com/security/notices>`__) for your
kernel.
