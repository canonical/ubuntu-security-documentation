FIPS for Ubuntu
###############

Ubuntu Pro provides access to FIPS-certified cryptographic packages, allowing you to deploy workloads that need to operate under compliance regimes like FedRAMP, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Canonical works with NIST-approved testing labs to certify the core cryptographic modules within Ubuntu for FIPS requirements, enabling applications to use these libraries in compliance with the FIPS standard.
