Compliance automation
#####################

Ubuntu Pro has been designed to simplify your security compliance burden for frameworks such as NIST, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS, ISO27001, or CIS. Pro includes security vulnerability patching for up to 12 years, FIPS-validated cryptographic modules, and automated system hardening for CIS and DISA STIG, and can be deployed on-premise or in the public cloud. 

Ubuntu Security Guide
=====================

The default configuration of Ubuntu balances usability and security. However, systems carrying dedicated workloads can be further hardened to reduce their attack surface. Canonical provides the Ubuntu Security Guide to automatically harden systems to DISA STIG and CIS benchmarks profiles, and generate audit reports. Available with Ubuntu Pro on-premise or ready-built on public clouds.

FIPS-certified packages
=======================

Ubuntu Pro provides access to FIPS 140 certified cryptographic packages, allowing you to deploy workloads that need to operate under compliance regimes like FedRAMP, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Canonical works with NIST-approved testing labs to certify the core cryptographic modules within Ubuntu for FIPS 140 requirements, enabling applications to use these libraries in compliance with the FIPS standard.
