Service access problem
######################

Network access to the Ubuntu Livepatch Service
(`https://livepatch.canonical.com:443 <https://livepatch.canonical.com/>`__)
is necessary as well as snapd version 2.15 - check your snapd version
with ``snap version``.

In addition to that, sometimes it could be a problem with the proxy
configurations. Please check out
`this </client/how-to-guides/configure-proxy>`__ guide on how to
configure the Livepatch client to use a proxy.
