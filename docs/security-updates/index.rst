Security updates
################

Each Ubuntu LTS release enables state of the art protection against vulnerability exploitation and malware. Canonical has a public vulnerability disclosure policy and vulnerabilities are fixed with automated security updates and kernel livepatches and publicly disclosed with our security notices. We further provide machine readable OVAL CVE output to be used by OpenSCAP and other 3rd party vulnerability management tools. Critical CVEs are typically patched within 24 hours.
