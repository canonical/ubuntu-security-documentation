Compliance automation
#####################

Ubuntu Pro simplifies security compliance burden for frameworks 
such as NIST CSF, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS, ISO27001, or CIS Benchmarks. Pro includes 
security vulnerability patching for up to 12 years, FIPS-validated
cryptographic modules, and automated system hardening for CIS Benchmarks and
DISA STIG. You can deploy it on-premise or in the public cloud. 

Ubuntu Security Guide
=====================

The default configuration of Ubuntu balances usability and security.
However, you can further harden systems carrying dedicated workloads
to reduce their attack surface. Canonical provides the Ubuntu Security
Guide to automatically harden systems to DISA STIG and CIS benchmarks
profiles and generate audit reports. It's available with Ubuntu Pro 
on-premise or ready-built on public clouds.

FIPS-certified packages
=======================

Ubuntu Pro provides access to FIPS 140 certified cryptographic packages,
so you can deploy workloads that need to operate under compliance regimes
like FedRAMP, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Canonical works with NIST-approved 
testing labs to certify the core cryptographic modules within Ubuntu for
FIPS 140 requirements. This enables applications to use these libraries 
in compliance with the FIPS standard.
