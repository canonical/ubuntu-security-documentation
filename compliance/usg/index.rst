Ubuntu Security Guide (USG)
###########################

Security Technical Implementation Guides, such as the CIS Benchmarks or
DISA-STIG, contain hundreds of configuration recommendations. Manually
hardening and auditing a Linux system is often tedious. The Ubuntu Security
Guide (USG) simplifies this process and allows you to customize configurations
for your specific environment.
