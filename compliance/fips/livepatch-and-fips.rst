FIPS and Livepatch
##################

The Livepatch service provides security updates to the running Linux kernel.
This allows you to patch critical workloads without rebooting immediately.

Livepatch works with ``fips-updates``, but it isn't available with the strict
``fips`` or ``fips-preview`` modes.
