Encrypted LVM
=============

Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) and newer releases allow you to install Ubuntu
onto an encrypted LVM. This allows you to encrypt all partitions in the logical
volume, including swap. Between Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake) and Ubuntu 12.04
LTS (Precise Pangolin), the alternate installer could install to an encrypted
LVM.
